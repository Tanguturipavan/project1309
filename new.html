    <p> Real time identification systems are very important and needful for safety, security rule following
        and socialism and also for own safety concerns. Traffic rules are important for safety as traffic
        laws are to prevent drivers of vehicles from causing accidents or hitting pedestrians. They are also
        to help control the flow of traffic so that it is more efficient. Traffic Rule Violations are leading
        cause of accidents, according to WHO India is a leading country in casualties occurring on road.
        The current system uses human interaction for rule violation detection, as it is a manual process it
        has some limitations, on multiple occasions we find the system gets corrupt. An alternative solution 
        would be AI-developed System. With our system, we can detect multiple rule violations,for 
        example, Vehicle crossing signal during red light or driving without a helmet, etc. Basic idea is to 
        detect these violations through preinstalled cameras. We can do it by ML based algorithm where 
        we can detect the violators by Image Processing, getting the numbe </p>
